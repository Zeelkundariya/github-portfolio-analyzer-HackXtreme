# 🚀 GitHub Portfolio Analyzer (v10.1-REAL)


> **"Your GitHub profile is your new resume. Don't let it be a ghost town."**

The **GitHub Portfolio Analyzer** is a multi-stage technical auditing engine designed to deconstruct engineering DNA. It turns silent repositories into a high-fidelity, recruiter-ready professional grade.

## 🎯 Our Mission
This tool bridges the gap between raw code and industry employability by providing:
1.  **Quantitative Audit**: A deterministic 0-100 "Engineering Authority" score.
2.  **Qualitative Analysis**: AI-driven technical feedback and recruiter verdicts.
3.  **Actionable Growth**: Individual repository "Revival Plans" to fix technical debt.
4.  **Professional Signaling**: Converting commit history into an organic engineering chronicle.

## 🧩 Features & High-Fidelity Modules
We analyze your profile through a deep-system lens:
*   **🕵️‍♂️ Recruiter Simulator (v10.1)**: Interactive, AI-led technical deep-dives. Simulate a CTO audit based on your real repository telemetry.
*   **📊 Deterministic Scoring**: A stabilized, non-fluctuating algorithm that weights original work, community impact, and architectural depth.
*   **💎 High-Impact System Logs**: Dynamic engineering journaling that replaces generic logs with varied, professional technical chronicles.
*   **🏗️ Architectural X-Ray**: Visual tree mapping of repository structures to detect project organization levels.
*   **📉 The Shadow Profile**: AI-driven gap analysis benchmarking your profile against Big Tech Staff-level engineering standards.
*   **🚀 Repository Revival Engine**: Generates a **High-Fidelity Refactor Plan** to turn stale code into portfolio-grade assets.
*   **🌍 Total Contribution Analysis**: Deep-dive tracking using the GitHub Search API to map your entire technical history.

## 🏆 The Engineering Signal Algorithm (v10.1)
The engine uses **Heuristic Content Analysis** and **Pattern-Based Activity Scanning** to calculate your grade.

### 1. Architectural Depth (Capped @ 75%)
A deterministic formula measuring high-impact technical signals:
- **Baseline (35 pts)**: Automatic detection of repository structure.
- **Complexity (+5 pts)**: Large-scale repositories (>3MB).
- **Influence (+8 pts)**: Star-to-Fork impact ratio.
- **Variety (+4 pts)**: Polyglot mastery across distinct languages.

### 2. Engineering Velocity (25 Points)
- **Active Momentum**: Scoring based on commit frequency and sustained coding discipline.
- **Conventional Discipline**: Multiplier for using industry-standard commit patterns (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`).

### 3. Repository Quality & Hygiene (40 Points)
- **Documentation Density**: Weighted analysis of README visibility and metadata.
- **Security Audit**: Automated scan for exposed secrets, `.env` files, or high-risk credential patterns.
- **Profile Branding**: Bio, social counts, and professional link connectivity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, Recharts, Primer/Octicons (Glassmorphism design)
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express (Isolated Port 5001), SQLite3
*   **APIs**: GitHub REST API, Google Gemini AI (Interview Logic)

## 📦 Setup & Run

### ⚡ One-Click Start (Windows)
```powershell
./run.ps1
```
This installs dependencies, starts the **v10.1-STABLE** backend on Port 5001, and opens the dashboard immediately.

### Manual Setup
1.  **Clone the Repo**
2.  **Backend**: `cd backend && npm install && node server.js`
3.  **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
